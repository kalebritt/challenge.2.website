        I read about it all the time, and hear folks talking about their outrage and incredulousness that this could
        happen in this day and age and so close to home. How can this be allowed to happen and who do those monsters
        think they are, what gives them the right to treat human beings that way, so what who they are and how they got
        here, they’re human beings and no one can treat anyone that way. What about the children? There’s nothing I can
        do, I’ve got kids of my own, two daughters who need me and I consider what I do for them fighting and it’s all I
        do with my time so how can I fight for other folk’s daughters? If I’m fighting for mine, surely they can feel it
        over there in cages? Surely their parents feel the struggle I’m putting up for my offspring and, hell, I’ll
        struggle harder now, I’ll think of those kids the whole time I’m fighting for my own, locked up, suffering in
        heat, starvation, and separation from my parents, their parents, I mean. Suffering in heat. Starving in heat.
        Strangers rattling the bars, strange men with guns and weapons speaking a foreign language. Yelling through the
        bars. Yelling something foreign and strange. Their eyes are wide and they are afraid. They don’t understand the
        words. They would comply but they don’t understand, they would do anything if he will stop screaming but they
        don’t understand the words. Their cowering implores the man and he shouts loud gesticulating with his arms in a
        language they cannot understand. Daughters. Someone’s. Sons too. I can hear them. They are next to me crying
        when he is gone. They can’t cry when he is there, he yells more and louder, so they cry when he leaves. The
        listen for his fading footsteps. They wait til they have faded. Then they cry.
