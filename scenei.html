            They took her away from his body and left his body where they shot him and they did not move him until
            he decomposed into the ground underneath their feet. They wanted her to see and after they shot her they
            wanted everyone else to see so that they would know the consequences so we all stepped over his body
            because they blocked the other paths and sometimes when the thoroughfare is too crowded we cannot help
            but walk upon his body. I knew them when they were together and I didn’t tell anyone about it. I suspect
            they already know and soon I’ll hear footsteps and then I won’t hear anything. They’ll wait until I am
            somewhere with lots of witnesses so we all know what happens to the silent nonconformers to dissuade a
            would be noncompliance, unspoken or otherwise. If you saw something it is your compelled duty to report
            it, your duty to your fellow compliant human, and if you fail in this regard it will be seen by the
            conforming masses as an act of terrorism and they will set upon him with a righteous fury condemning
            inaction as cowardice, cowardice for seeing and watching that which I know is wrong, wrong, wrong! The
            consummation of immoral attitude in amoral action, as if the thought isn’t evil enough, the despicable
            scum, they’ve got to go ahead and act out upon wicked impulse and it crosses a line, it crosses all
            established divisions of what is allowed and what is not allowed, and it makes me sick and I welcome the
            consequences they welcome upon themselves, and I am happy for it, and if one of the consequences is
            suffering than I am happy for that too and if they try and tell you they didn’t know what was coming, or
            they don’t deserve what is now upon them, then they are lying and they are liars and they deserve even
            more the hardship and suffering they have brought upon themselves and they deserve more than that too,
            generations of torment and indebtedness that they are allowed generations and not just wiped out like
            the waste they are. Lock them up. Lock them up and cage them in, and maybe then we’ll be rid of them.
